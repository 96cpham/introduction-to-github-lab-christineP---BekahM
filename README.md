# Introduction to Git and Github

## Background
Git is a distributed version control system. In layman's terms, this is a piece of software that helps you organize your projects whether you work alone or collaborate with others. It has become integral to the world of STEM as it helped replace the olden days of sending code back and forth through emails. It generates a history of every change you've made and keeps those changes so collaborators can see exactly what others have worked on and make contributions to others work.

The difference between Git and Github is that git is a separate software created back in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, the same person who created the Linux operating system. Github is a cloud computing implementation of git created in 2008. This is the equivalent of Microsoft Word being created, then Google Drive coming along and allowing you to collaborate and access your documents from multiple devices without having to email them back and forth
